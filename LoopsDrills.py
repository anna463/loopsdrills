For this assignment you should read the task, then below the task do what it asks you to do
based on what the task tells you do first.
EXAMPLE TASK:
'''
#EX) Declare a variable set to 3. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 0.
i = 3;
while i > 0:
    print(i)
    i -= 1

'''While Loops'''
#1) Declare a variable set to 4. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and decrements the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 1.
i = 4
while i > 1:
    print (i)
    i -= 1


#2) Declare a variable set to 14. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#    you just created and increments the variable by one each time through
#    the loop. Meanwhile, make the loop run until the variable you created 
#    equals 20.
i = 14
while i > 20:
    print (i)
    i -= 20
#3) Declare a variable set to 55. Make a while loop that prints the variable 
#   you just created. Then make an if statement that makes the loop break when
#   the variable is equal to 50. 
i = 55
while i > 50:
    print (i)
    i -= 50


'''For Loops'''
#4) Create a list named sports. Put three sports into the list. Create
#   a for loop that prints each sport in the list
Sports = ["hockey","soccer","tennis"]
for x in Sports:
    print (x)
#5) Create a for loop that loops through each letter in a string of one of your
#   favorite songs. Each iteration should print should a letter of the word. 
x = "twinkletwinkle"
while (True):
    print (x)
    x = x + 3
    if (x >= 10):
